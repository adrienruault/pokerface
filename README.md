# pokerface

`gameframework` is a package that emulates poker games.



## Tests

**run the tests**: run the command `pytest`. It automatically finds files starting with "test_" and run them.

**Get line coverage**: run the command `py.test --cov=gameframework .`. It is the same as running `pytest` but also computes the line coverage in `gameframework`
